                <p>&emsp;First of all, happy pride month! I feel a little strange about pride month because I'm still not sure if I identify with the LGBTQ+ community. If I were to be specific about my sexuality, I identify as bisexual heteroromantic, which essentially means I'm attracted to both males and females, but only romantically attracted to females. You might think "well then you're bi!" but honestly, I don't know. I feel like "bi" is reserved for people who are equally into men and women, and that's not the case for me. I still prefer women, both sexually and romantically, I just also enjoy men. If I were to put a label on it, it would be something like "bicurious", especially since I've never had any sexual interactions with a male yet, so I can't quite confirm if I'm even bisexual. Regardless, it really doesn't matter what label I decide to put on it because it doesn't change that I'm still seeking a partner of the opposite sex; I just might explore the same sex a little in the meantime.</p>
                <p>&emsp;On to some other updates, I ended up not getting the internship I was hoping for this Summer, so I'm kinda bummed about that. However, I've been offered to work an event with the guy who was running the internship, and also work with another audio guy whom I discovered by playing in the pit orchestra for a theatre show. On top of that, I've been working on some production stuff such as tracking piano for someone's track, and also working on a track of my own. I'm going to try recreating "Wake" from the end cutscene of Tales of Eternia. I already have the piano part transcribed, but I'm also going to transcribe all the other parts, find some people to play them, and then attempt to mix them all together into a video. You can listen to the song in question <a href="https://youtu.be/U2n7eD_jwQw?t=1842" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                <p>&emsp;So in a nutshell, despite not getting the internship I wanted, there's still plenty of things I can do with all the time I have now! I also started doing Doordash again, since I should be making some sort of income. I think that's all the updates I wanted to give, so thanks for reading!</p>

                <p>&emsp;It's happening; I'm making this blog live. After seeing it on <a href="https://njtucker.xyz/" target="_blank">Nate Tucker's website</a>, I decided I want to go forward with having this page. I think at the very least, it would be a good tool for me to reflect on various happenings in life, and would give me a good place to ramble. My hope would be to update this once or twice a month, and we'll see where it goes from there.</p>
                <p>&emsp;As far as life updates go, I'm doing alright! Just finished my junior year of college. Still wanting to do audio engineering, and am waiting to hear back about a live sound internship. Right now I don't have a lot going on other than playing keyboard 2 for a community theatre. They're doing The Full Monty, and it's been really fun! I finally got to use Mainstage 3 in a real performance setting, and it's worked great. Once the M2 MacBook Air's come out, I'm definitely going to pull the trigger on one of them so I can use them for music/life performance stuff.</p>
                <p>&emsp;I've also been working hard on personal projects recently, including this website. Nothing too major here, just a bunch of small updates. I did publish an app to the Google Play store recently, and I'm waiting for it to be reviewed before it's officially published. Don't get your hopes up, it's an incredibly simple app, but I thought it would be interesting to go through the process of publishing it (and it would be kind of cool to be able to brag about having an app on the Play store.)</p>
                <p>&emsp;I think that's all I've got for now. Thanks for reading, and I'll do my best to keep this blog updated regularly!</p>

                <p>&emsp;It's been almost a month since this whole quarantine thing has started, and it's been quite interesting. We've all learned a lot, and I thought I might share personally how I feel about this whole self-isolating thing.</p>
                <p>&emsp;As far as school-work goes, doing all my work online has it's pros and cons. As far as pros go, I feel like the biggest advantage I personally have is now I actually have the time to sit down and study for my classes. Before, I would be bogged down by so many other activities I'm involved in, and while I love being involved in so many things, it doesn't leave much (or any really) time for me to study for my classes. In fact, the only real 'studying' I've ever been able to do is attending lectures, doing homework, and cramming the day of/night before exams. That's all I would have time for. Yes, I realize that's unhealthy, but so far it's working alright.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Being able to sit down, read the textbooks, watch lecture videos, and take detailed notes has made a huge learning impact for me (who would've thought). Now, I'm no longer stressed about not having enough time to do these things, because I have all the time in the world! These new studying habits have been quite effective, that is, as long as I'm able to stay focused.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Here's where the cons start to come into play. It is <em>very</em> easy for me to get distracted while I'm on my own. Why study when I could grab my bass guitar and work on my technique instead? Why do homework when I could scroll through Instagram/talk to my friends instead? That last one usually happens when I become frustrated with myself for being unable to do a problem. Another thing that has been hard to figure out is a decent sleeping schedule. I seem to be staying up later and later, and waking up later and later each day. In fact, I'm currently writing this post at 3am. Why? I have no idea.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Anyways, I just wanted to share some of the thoughts I had on this whole situation. It's nice to have time to work on things, however it's hard to keep distractions away. Hopefully, I figure out a better way to manage my time during this self-isolation period so I can be more productive, and do some other things I want to do like work out (oh yeah, I feel like my body is physically deteriorating due to lack of physical activity), make music, and play through some JRPGs.</p>
                <p>&emsp;That's all for now. Maybe if I keep this up, I'll actually have a decent blog. Thanks again for reading!</p>

            <div class="card-header">
                <h5 class="card-title">First Blog Post<button class="btn btn-link copyBlogLink" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Copy link to this blog post."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></button></h5>

            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>&emsp;Well, this is the first blog post for this website. For now, this is all going to be in it's own
                    separate Git branch until I know for sure that I will actually use this enough to put it on the
                    production site.</p>
                <p>&emsp;For now, I can talk a little bit about how this website is going. At this point, I've spent well
                    over 30 hours (probably going on 35 now), and I've been having an absolute blast. I haven't had really
                    anything else to do during this Coronavirus quarantine period, so this project has been a blessing.</p>
                <p>&emsp;There's still a few things I have left to do still. The main thing will be getting this site up and
                    running on the Raspberry Pi WH I have. Currently, the Pi is out of commission until I get a adapter in
                    the mail to connect it to ethernet and I can debug it over SSH. Then, I'll have to go through the whole
                    process of setting up the Apache webserver, pointing the domain to the webserver, port-forwarding, and
                    getting a SSL certificate.</p>
                <p>&emsp;For now though, until that part comes in I think I need to take a break from working on this
                    website. I've been working almost feverishly on this, which is fine because I haven't had anything else
                    to do really, but at the same time, I should do something else other than this all day/night.</p>
                <p>&emsp;Thanks for reading!</p>
