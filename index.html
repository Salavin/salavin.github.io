            <h1>Welcome to my website! <span class="darkmode-ignore" style="z-index: -1">ðŸ‘‹</span></h1>

            <p>&emsp;I am Sam Lavin: music geek, audiophile, and avid technology enthusiast. Currently, I am the
                Production Intern at 88.5 KURE Ames Alternative, and also the Secretary and Accompanist for the Alpha
                Delta chapter of the Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Men's Music Fraternity. I am a Sophomore Computer Engineering
                student at Iowa State University pursuing minors in Music and Music Technology. When I graduate, I would
                like to work in Music Production and Audio Engineering.</p>
            <h2>A (semi) short auto-biography:</h2>

            <p>&emsp;All my life, I have always loved technology. I always loved messing with the Windows PC we had in
                our home (hence why I am still a Windows user to this day, despite its flaws) and finding all the in's
                and out's of it. I remember my first coding experience was around 6th or 7th grade when I discovered
                batch files. I found out that you could write programs with it using many <em>many</em> <code>GO-TO</code>
                statements, and so I began writing my own weird text-based Pokemon game. I believe I actually got
                decently far with writing it, especially for how little I knew of programming back then. Eventually,
                there became too many <code>GO-TO</code> statements, and I never saw the program again.</p>
            <p>&emsp;From there, I continued to learn more about the world of programming and technology. I learned
                about Scratch: a visual, block-based programming language built out of MIT. I programmed
                a <strong>very</strong> large game that involved sending a rocket to space, fighting aliens, and then
                landing on the moon. My plan was that once you landed on the moon, you would have to fight more aliens,
                but the computer I was using at the time to program the game couldn't handle everything I was writing.
                Eventually, it became painfully slow, and I had to move on. You can still find the game
                <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12972026/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
            <p>&emsp;At this point, high school came along, and I got much more involved with extracurriculars and
                academics that didn't leave much time for experimenting with programming. This is when I started to
                become heavily involved with music. I was still involved with track, cross-country, show choir, and
                choir from middle-school, however, they were obviously much more intense at the high-school level. I
                joined the marching band on first trumpet freshman year. Unfortunately I encountered major problems with playing
                after having my braces taken out. After marching band, I moved to playing baritone for concert band.
                This was quite a change moving from a melodic-based treble clef instrument that is played in the key of
                Bb, to a bass clef instrument that is played in the key of C. However, playing in a different clef
                wasn't so much of a big deal thanks to the fact that I had been playing piano for 7 years at this point,
                and overall it ended up working out okay. I played baritone for marching band my sophomore year, and
                then was convinced to switch to tuba by one of my good tuba friends who was graduating. This was not as
                hard of a transition from baritone, and I ended up liking the tuba so much that I stuck with it to this
                day. Junior and senior years I auditioned for the Iowa All-State band on tuba, and was accepted as a
                first-alternate my senior year. I also picked up playing the bass guitar towards the end of my sophomore
                year, and joined the jazz band on bass for my junior and senior years.</p>
            <p>&emsp;Needless to say, I became very musically-adept through high school. I earned many division I
                ratings at solo/ensemble contests, lettered almost every year in all the ensembles I was in, and was
                recognized with the highest award in our band, the John Philip Sousa Award. My senior year, I went back
                and forth a lot trying to decide if I wanted to do engineering or music in the future. Eventually, I
                decided engineering was the way to go. Freshman year of college I loved computer engineering, but that
                love did not continue into sophomore year.</p>
            <p>&emsp;When I came to ISU, you could probably imagine that I became as much or more musically involved
                than I did in high school, and you would be right. I joined marching band on sousaphone, men's choir, a
                mixed choir, the Phi Mu Alpha Men's Music Fraternity, pep band on bass guitar, Cyclone Sound (a WGI Winds
                group), accompanied 2 musicals, and even played with the tuba studio for a while. Sometime sophomore
                year, I realized that my true passion was really with music, and I needed to change my career path to
                reflect that. At the time, I was working as a paid full-stack web developer for ISU Web Dev. I
                ended up quitting this job in favor of becoming an unpaid production intern for 88.5 KURE
                Ames Alternative. While I still haven't had a lot of time there yet, I can at least tell I am on the
                right track for what I want to do. I have had many opportunities open up recently, and hopefully they
                show up somewhere on this website.</p>

                            <p>&emsp;Imagine that you're me, getting ready in the morning for classes, probably in a rush because you woke up late. You go to open the MyState app to see when the next bus is coming, only to be signed out of the app by some unknown bug. By the time you get signed in again, you see that you are too late for the bus, and will have to wait until the next one.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;These frustrations are what prompted me to design a smart display. This smart display would be something you can look at quickly in the morning to find out when your next bus is, what the weather will be like for the day, and more.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;I worked on this project in my CprE 186 class along with 2 others. We decided to use Python as the backbone for the project as we could install many third-party packages that would allow us to interface with the outside world (more specifically, the Internet of Things).</p>
                            <p>&emsp;The smart display would physically consist of only a few items: a Raspberry Pi WH to drive the display, a $5 monitor we found at the Surplus Store, and all the necessary cables to connect the two. On the display, we would display three different screens that each would have their own purpose. Those screens included:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>A CyRide bus prediction screen,</li>
                                <li>A weather screen,</li>
                                <li>And a multi-user Google Calendar page that also displayed what roommates are home based on their phone's location.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>&emsp;The GUI powering these screens would be TkInter. While this wasn't the most preferable choice, we didn't have much overhead or storage space to download a different GUI module, and TkInter is included with Python. Now, let's dive into each of these different screens. Unfortunately, none of us thought to grab screenshots of these in production, and getting the project to work now will be a massive pain as the API I used to grab CyRide data is now discontinued. However, I can do my best to describe them.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <h3>CyRide</h3>
                            <p>&emsp;The CyRide screen was essentially my part of the project (along with getting TkInter to work for our project). For this, I used the public CyRide API at the time to request an XML file, parse through that file, and grab the prediction times until the next bus for a certain stop. The bus stop itself was hard-coded in, however I could have programmed it to use a constant for the bus stop ID, and then by simply changing that constant, it could show different predictions.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;Here is an example of what this screen would have looked like:</p>
                            <div style="text-align: center">
                                <div class="card bg-dark card-darkmode-ignore darkmode-ignore border-light"
                                     style="display: inline-block">

                                         style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Helvetica', serif; color: white">

                                        <p class="timeFont">1m 02s</p>
                                        <p class="busFont" style="color: blue">3 Blue:</p>
                                        <p class="timeFont">0m 26s</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <h3>Weather</h3>
                            <p>&emsp;Next in the lineup is the weather screen. This screen showed the current temperature, the high and low for the day, an hourly forecast from the current hour, and a 5 day forecast. We had also planned to implement a temperature sensor onto a couple of the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, however we ended up running out of time before we could get to that. </p>
                            <p>&emsp;Unfortunately, I can't provide an example of what this screen looked like due to the fact that I am not as familiar with this screen as I didn't work on it, and also because from what I remember, the GUI for this screen was quite complex.</p>
                            <h3>Google Calendar</h3>
                            <p>&emsp;The last piece of our trilogy here is the Google Calendar. This screen displayed all of each user's upcoming events for the day (to help you plan for the day), and also showed whether each user was home or not. The latter was achieved by using a combination of IFTTT and Adafruit.io. Basically, whenever one of the users entered or left a geofenced area, IFTTT would send some data to a dashboard that we set up on Adafruit.io updating whether or not they were home. Then, our program would check that data and update the screen accordingly.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;I helped a little bit with the design of this last component, so I can give a rough idea of what it ended up looking like. Basically, there were 3 columns (for each of the 'roommates'), a header that had the user's name and whether they were home or not, and then the rest of the column was dedicated to any events the user had for the day. You can see a blurry version of what this screen looked like in the picture below!</p>

                            <p>&emsp;Overall, we learned a lot through this project. The biggest things we learned about were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How to use different packages with Python.</li>
                                <li>How to use XML and ElementTree.</li>
                                <li>How to use Python Objectively.</li>
                                <li>How to use Git and collaborate with each other.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>&emsp;There are also some things we <em>definitely</em> could have improved on. I already mentioned improving how the bus stop was hard-coded, and also adding a temperature sensor for reporting indoor temperature along with the outdoor. We also wished we could have rewired the inside of the display we were using to output power through the usb ports on the back <u>without</u> needing a USB uplink. Looking back on the project now, I also wish we would have documented more of the progress we made, commented/cleaned up more of our code, and made it more readable.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;All in all, it was a very fun project to work on, and I'm very proud of the final result we came out with. You can view the GitHub repository for the project <a href="https://github.com/Salavin/PiHeads" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

                            <p>&emsp;Ever since I started web development at ISU WebDev, I have always wanted to host my own website specifically for future employers to get to know me better. I wanted to write the entire thing myself, and not use sites that build a website for you. So one day, I registered this domain name, and attempted to get started on building this site. However, I was trying to use Laravel on the same Raspberry Pi Zero WH that I had used from the Smart Display project above, and Laravel was <u>not</u> having it. Basically, Laravel apparently requires more than 512MB of RAM to run, which is all the little Pi Zero had. So, I instead went out and rented some server space with a little more RAM, and attempted to start again. It was at this point that I learned Laravel was quite different from ZF2 (the framework that we used at WebDev), and I didn't have much time or motivation to ride that learning curve. On top of that, the company that I was renting server space from kept corrupting my OS, and so eventually this project was put on the backburner.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;Eventually, I realized that I didn't need an entire framework to do what I want. Instead, I can literally return a single html page that uses Bootstrap's navs to switch between pages. And so Spring break 2020, I sat down and wrote out this entire site in a matter of a couple days.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;This site runs purely off of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In conjunction with that, I am also using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to help design the site, <a href="http://fontawesome.com" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> for a few icons, and <a href="https://darkmodejs.learn.uno/" target="_blank">Darkmode.js</a> for an easy to implement darkmode (because <b>everything</b> should have a darkmode option). If you haven't figured out how to use it yet, just click the little <i class="fas fa-moon"></i> icon on the far right of the navbar above!</p>
                            <p>&emsp;Getting the site on the World Wide Web was relatively simple. I already owned the domain name, so I just had to do a fresh install of Raspbian for my Raspberry Pi Zero, get Apache set up, pull the repository, change a few configs, get an SSL certificate from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>, and then point my domain to the Raspberry Pi Zero. </p>
                            <p>&emsp;This project was incredibly fun for me to do. I've spent around 35-40 hours on it now, and I'm very proud of what the final product looks like.

                            <h3>Mailbox Sensor</h3>
                            <p>&emsp;The first project I ever did that involved physical components involved a Raspberry Pi B+, an RF transmitter/receiver pair from <a href="http://lowpowerlab.com">lowpowerlab</a>, and a tiny OLED display. Put simply, the motion detector sat our in our mailbox, and when it detected motion, would send a signal to the RF receiver that was in the house. This would communicate to the Raspberry Pi over FTDI to let it know that the mail had arrived. The Raspberry Pi would then send a text message using Python to everyone in our house, and also display a mail icon on the OLED display. Then, when the sensor detected motion again, it would send another text letting us know that someone got the mail, and turn off the OLED display.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;While this project was good for me in the sense that it introduced me to a <u>lot</u> of new concepts, it was quite over my head, and not exactly the most fun to try and figure out. It was fun at the very end when I finally got it all working, however the sensor was too sensitive and would send many false-positives. Thinking about it now, I easily should have been able to tinker with the sensitivity of the sensor. Unfortunately, it became untrustworthy and I eventually took it down so I could use the Raspberry Pi for other things.</p>

                            <h3>Marble Sorter</h3>
                            <p>&emsp;Sophomore year of high school, I took the Project Lead the Way class Principles of Engineering. One of the first things we did in the class was build a robotic marble sorter. This sorter had to take 20 marbles, and sort them into 5 different types: wood, metal, clear, rose gold, and opaque. This was done using a combination of moving robotic parts (all programmed in Robot C), a controllable magnet to pull out the magnetic marbles, and a light sensor. You can find a video of the project in action below:</p>

                            JavaScript skills. So, I found a website that had a bunch of challenges on it, and worked on
                            all of them until I got them right.</p>
                            <p>&emsp;I also made two fun pages that you can visit: a <a href="rainbow.html">rainbow</a> page that's really fun to explore if you have an infinite scrolling mouse, and a <a href="wordClock.html">word clock</a>.</p>
